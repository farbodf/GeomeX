Dependencies
------------

In order to be able to run the project you need to have

Moonlander is a library that integrates Processing with GNU Rocket to allow time-based variables in sketches. Moonlander should be inside the library directory of Processing's sketchbooks path.
In addition, you need the minim libarary installed 
(available within Processing extensions)
